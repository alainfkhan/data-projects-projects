It captures the volatility of the \"Christmas Bull Run,\" specifically focusing on the divergence between institutional \"Blue Chips\" (Bitcoin, Solana, XRP) and the viral \"Memecoin Supercycle\" (Pepe, Bonk, Dogwifhat).\n\nUnlike standard daily datasets, this granular minute-by-minute view allows data scientists to analyze **micro-volatility**, liquidity flows, and rapid price action during peak trading hours.\n\n**Key Assets Included:**\n*   **Layer 1 Giants:** Bitcoin (`BTC`), Ethereum (`ETH`), Solana (`SOL`), XRP (`XRP`), Near Protocol (`NEAR`).\n*   **Viral Memecoins:** Dogecoin (`DOGE`), Pepe (`PEPE`), Bonk (`BONK`), Shiba Inu (`SHIB`), Dogwifhat (`WIF`).\n*   **AI Sector:** Render (`RENDER`).\n\n# **Data Science Applications**\nThis dataset is optimized for financial modeling and time-series forecasting tasks:\n*   **High-Frequency Algorithmic Trading:** Train LSTM or GRU models to predict price movements on a minute-by-minute basis.\n*   **Volatility Clustering:** Analyze periods of extreme variance (heteroskedasticity) using GARCH models.\n*   **\"Memecoin Supercycle\" Analysis:** Quantify the correlation between Bitcoin's stability and Memecoin explosions.\n*   **Arbitrage Detection:** Identify price inefficiencies between correlated assets (e.g., SOL vs. BONK).\n*   **Liquidity Visualization:** Map trading volume spikes during key December 2025 news events.\n\n# **Column Descriptors**\nThe dataset follows a clean \"Long Format\" structure (No `NaN` gaps):\n\n| Column Name | Data Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `timestamp` | DateTime | UTC timestamp of the 1-minute candle (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). |\n| `asset` | String | The common name of the cryptocurrency (e.g., \"Bitcoin\", \"Pepe\"). |\n| `symbol` | String | The specific trading pair ticker (e.g., \"BTC-USD\", \"PEPE24478-USD\"). |\n| `open` | Float | The price at the **start** of the minute candle. |\n| `high` | Float | The **highest** price reached during that minute. |\n| `low` | Float | The **lowest** price reached during that minute. |\n| `close` | Float | The price at the **end** of the minute candle. |\n| `volume` | Float | The total value traded during that minute (in USD). |\n\n# **Ethically Obtained Data**\n*   **Source:** Data is retrieved via the public Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`).\n*   **Compliance:** This dataset contains only public market data (OHLCV). It contains no personal user data, private transaction histories, or proprietary wallet information.\n*   **Usage:** Intended for educational, research, and analytical purposes.\n\n# **Acknowledgements**\nData provided by **Yahoo Finance**.\nImage **Dall-E3**.\n\n", "keywords": ["finance", "science and technology", "internet", "investing", "currencies and foreign exchange"], "licenses": [{"name": "ODC Attribution License (ODC-By)"}]}}
