issues:

makefile on windows

this works:
.PHONY: test
test:
    conda list --export

this does not work:
.PHONY: test
test:
    conda list --export > test.txt

$ make test
conda list --export > test.txt
/usr/bin/sh: line 1: conda: command not found
make: *** [Makefile:5: test] Error 127

$ which conda
which: no conda in (...)

$ where conda
C:\Users\<user>\miniconda3\condabin\conda.bat

quick fix:
remember to:
conda list --export > requirements.txt
conda env export --from-history > environment.yml
before commit

note: make with conda works on macos
