    Description:
        This year’s class of America’s up-and-coming chains faces an uncertain future.
        But as the coronavirus hit, these small and innovative concepts were characteristically quick to adapt,
        repacking menu items into meal kits, creating pop-up drive-thrus and more.
        Here’s a look at how they got here, and where they plan to go next.
    How the research works:
        The Future 50 is a measure of the fastest-growing restaurant concepts
        with annual sales between $20 million and $50 million.
        Data is compiled by Technomic. 
        Rankings are based on percent change in systemwide sales from 2018 to 2019;
        chains must have also opened new units in 2019 to qualify.
        Unit counts are as of Dec. 31, 2019.
        When data was not provided, Technomic estimated sales based on public information, comparable concepts, market and other factors.

Independence100.csv:
    from: https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/top-100-independents-2020?year=2020#data-table
    Description:
        While the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the restaurant world, especially for independents, 2019 was a good year for many,
        and still worth recognizing. Restaurants in the Top 100 grossed nearly $1.8 billion in a tight labor market amid increased competition,
        outearning the prior year’s total. But 2020 has presented even greater challenges,
        and RB takes a look at how indies are weathering those as well.
    Methodology:
        RB’s Top 100 Independents ranking is a measure of the highest-grossing independent restaurants.
        Only restaurant concepts with no more than five locations are considered “independents”
        for the purpose of this list (although it’s possible a restaurant that shares a name with a chain
        but is owned and operated separately would qualify, such as Smith & Wollensky in New York City).
        Rankings are based on gross 2019 food and beverage sales. Information was gathered through surveys.
        When data wasn’t provided, sales were estimated based on public information, similar concepts and other factors.

    Top 500 Chains
        The Top 500 highest-grossing restaurant chains recorded their best overall performance in five years in 2019.
        Chicken had a moment, tech made another leap and the biggest chains got bigger.
        This annual report, in partnership with Technomic, highlights the data, trends and brands that defined the year.
