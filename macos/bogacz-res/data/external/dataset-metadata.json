Such a list (or actually 3 lists) was created by the \"Restaurant Business\" magazine. On the website you can find only basic information about ranked restaurants, full data and analyzes are available in the [paid report](https://www.technomic.com/reports/industry-reports/top-500).\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe data was obtained by means of web scraping, i.e. data download with the use of programming code based on the website code. In this case, the \"rvest\" package from the R programming language was used along with the \"SelectorGadet\" browser add-on to facilitate work with the website.\n\nThe data was downloaded from www.restaurantbusinessonline.com on January 30, 2021 with three plants describing 3 rankings: top 250, top 100 indenents and future 50 thus creating 3 tables, where the restaurant is described by several variables in each row.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThe data can be used to tell the story of what 2020 was like for restaurants, what was hot, what could be more popular soon, or what the difference is between large companies and smaller businesses. I am curious what useful information can be obtained from this data!\n\nPhoto by Luis Hansel on Unsplash.", "keywords": ["websites", "business", "marketing", "food", "restaurants"], "licenses": [{"name": "CC0-1.0"}]}}
